# Quantum Computing for Battery Design

Our short term approach involves using VQE [[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00348-9) and QEOM [[2]](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.043140) to extract the energy spectrum of a molecule specified with its geometry, charge, and spin. For a given candidate molecule, we compute this spectrum for both the its stable state and its ionized state, allowing us to look at the ionization energy and better understand the battery capabilities of the material. With the extracted energy spectrum, we compute thermodynamic properties of the molecule relevant to characterize its heat resistance. 

This approach was currently implemented for small molecules (H2 and LiH) as proof of concept. Our immediate next step is to study possible optimization approaches to make our current solution run on larger (but still relatively small) molecules. We can do this without the need to run huge circuits by using Microsoft's resource estimator [[3]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/intro-to-resource-estimation) to understand the requirements of different approaches without necesarily using a large amount of compute power.

For more complex molecules, we want to use an approach based on phase estimation [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08017) [[5]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06546) to get more accurate energy spectra for much more complicated molecules. With the resource estimator, the most direct implementation of this would require around ~500k qubits to be fault-tolerant. However, using this estimator we can start refining our approach without needing access to these large computers just yet.
